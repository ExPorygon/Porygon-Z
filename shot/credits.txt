v2: Fixed delay graphic and added optional improved ones for each color at the bottom of the texture for use in custom delay effect code (top left is at x=0,y=2013 and their dimensions are 33x33). Improved the graphics of butterflies and notes.

A shot sheet that imitates ZUN's (with some little extra animation and changes) but they're all handmade by me so feel free to use them.

This one improves over my previous by being clearer, having slightly larger shots, and eliminating the weird lines that showed up around some shots.

To use, simply copy all the files somewhere and then include the Shotconstants.dnh when you need it.

Constants for the shots are formatted like this: TYPE_COLOR (for example, KNIFE_RED).
